# machine-learning-algorithm-work
## Following machine learning algorithms are implemented - </br>
1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Predicted a customer group from four "telecust.csv") </br>
2. Decision Tree ((Predicted a customer group from four "telecust.csv" ), (Predicted suitable drug for patient)</br>
3. Logistic Regresssion (Predicted customer churn in "churnData.csv" ) </br>
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) (Predicted a customer group from four "telecust.csv", here knn worked better than decision tree) </br>
5. Linear Regression (Predicted prices of cars in "automobiles.csv") </br>
6. Polynomial Regression (Predicted prices of cars) </br>
